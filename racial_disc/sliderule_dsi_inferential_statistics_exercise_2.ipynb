    "# Examining Racial Discrimination in the US Job Market\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "Racial discrimination continues to be pervasive in cultures throughout the world. Researchers examined the level of racial discrimination in the United States labor market by randomly assigning identical résumés to black-sounding or white-sounding names and observing the impact on requests for interviews from employers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "In the dataset provided, each row represents a resume. The 'race' column has two values, 'b' and 'w', indicating black-sounding and white-sounding. The column 'call' has two values, 1 and 0, indicating whether the resume received a call from employers or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the 'b' and 'w' values in race are assigned randomly to the resumes when presented to the employer."

    "Since the objective of this analysis is to verify whether race has significant impact to the call back rate, we should use two-sample test to compare the call back rate between white-sounding and back-sounding sample groups. \n",

    "2. The values have to come from the same distribution\n",
    "3. The values have to be drawn from a distribution with finite mean and variance\n",
    "4. The number of samples is enough\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the idantical resume was randomly assigned to back-sounding and white-sounding name, we can be a bit confident on the independency of the data. For the second criteria, sinc all the data were draw from the experience at once, they should come from the same distribution. Thirdly, the distribution of call-back is either 1 or 0 – a typical Bernoulli distribution with finite mean and variance. Lastly, the number of samples for each black-sounding and white-sounding group is 2435 – a sufficient amount of data for the convergnece of mean distribution. Therefore, CLT can still be apply to this case."
